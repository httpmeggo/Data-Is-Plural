# Data-Is-Plural
In this project you will be working with open data. Wikipedia has a good description of open data: "Open data is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control." In fact, you will be working with an open data set that is a collection of open data sets. Data is Plural is a project run by Jeremy Singer-Vine. You can subscribe to his newsletter and get a fresh collection of interesting data sets each week. Or, you can browse the archives dating back to 2015.

Your program will explore this data set and allow the user to make queries about it.


The goal of this programming project is for you to master (or at least get practice on) the following tasks:

- working with multi-file programs
- reading data from input files
- using and understanding command line arguments
- working with large data sets
- using the ArrayList class
- writing classes
- working with existing code
- extending existing classes (inheritance)
- parsing data
- working with exception handling

Many of the skills that you need to complete this project are based on the material covered in cs101. But there might be certain topics for which you did not have to write a program or that you forgot. Make sure to ask questions during recitations, in class and on Ed.
